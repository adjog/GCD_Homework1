# getdata-014 Course Project 1

This assumes you have :

1. downloaded [the homework data set](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) 

2. unzipped it

3. renamed the directory "UCH HAR Dataset" to "UCH_HAR_Dataset" (replace spaces)

4. are working in the directory above (containing) UCH_HAR_Dataset

The final run_analysis.R contains all the code other than the setup
code in the above four steps. It can be source'd within R
and the output should be a new file "activity_summary.txt"
in your working directory.

The code in run_analysis.R is documented internally, and yet more
details can be found in CodeBook.md
